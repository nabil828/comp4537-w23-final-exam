All the following options, the following code snippets will decrement the ages of animals in the `zoo` object by one except:
```js
const zoo = {
  "name": "My Zoo",
  "location": "City X",
  "animals": [
    {
      "name": "Lion",
      "species": "Panthera leo",
      "age": 5
    },
    {
      "name": "Tiger",
      "species": "Panthera tigris",
      "age": 3
    },
    {
      "name": "Bear",
      "species": "Ursus arctos",
      "age": 7
    }
  ]
};



```

A. 
```js
for (let i = 0; i < zoo.animals.length; i++) {
  zoo.animals[i].age = zoo.animals[i].age - 1;
}

``` 

B. 
```js
zoo.animals.forEach(animal => {
  return { ...animal, age: animal.age - 1 };
});
```

C. 
```js
const decrementedAges = zoo.animals.map(animal => {
  animal.age = animal.age - 1;
  return animal;
});

```

D. 
```js
const zoo.animals = zoo.animals.map(animal => {
  return { ...animal, age: animal.age - 1 };
});

```


Answer: B



Option B is incorrect because it uses forEach() to iterate through the zoo.animals array and attempts to decrement the age property of each animal object, but it returns a new object with the updated age property using the spread syntax ({ ...animal, age: animal.age - 1 }). However, the forEach() method does not return a new array; it only iterates through the array and performs an action on each element. So, this code will not actually update the zoo object and its animals array.

On the other hand, options A, C, and D are correct because they use for loop (A) or map() method (C, D) to directly update the age property of each animal object in the zoo object and its animals array by subtracting 1 from its current value. These options will correctly decrement the ages of animals in the zoo object.
