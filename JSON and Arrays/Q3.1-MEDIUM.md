For the following object, how can you decrement the ages of animals in the `zoo` object by one:
```js
const zoo = {
  "name": "My Zoo",
  "location": "City X",
  "animals": [
    {
      "name": "Lion",
      "species": "Panthera leo",
      "age": 5
    },
    {
      "name": "Tiger",
      "species": "Panthera tigris",
      "age": 3
    },
    {
      "name": "Bear",
      "species": "Ursus arctos",
      "age": 7
    }
  ]
};



```

A. 
```js
const decrementedAges = zoo.animals.map(animal => {
  animal.age--;
});
``` 

B. 
```js
const decrementedAges = zoo.animals.map(animal => {
  return { ...animal, age: animal.age-- };
});
```

C. 
```js
const decrementedAges = zoo.animals.map(animal => {
  return { ...animal, age: animal.age - 1 };
});
```

D. 
```js
const decrementedAges = zoo.animals.map(animal => {
  animal.age - 1;
});
```


Answer: C


D. Instead, it will return an array of undefined values because the map() function expects a return value for each element in the array. Additionally, it directly modifies the original zoo object by changing the age property values, which may not be desired if you want to keep the original object unchanged.


B. Issue: The -- operator is used as a postfix, which will not affect the current value of animal.age but only return the original value. So, the age property in the returned objects will have the same value as the original animal.age value, instead of being decremented.

A. Issue: The age property of the animals will not be decremented because the -- operator is used as a postfix, which means it will not affect the current value of animal.age but only return the original value.
