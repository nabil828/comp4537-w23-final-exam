  db.your_collection_name.aggregate([
    {
      $project: {
        person_name: "$name",
        person_age: "$age",
        first_pet_name: { $arrayElemAt: ["$pets.name", 0] },
        second_pet_name: { $arrayElemAt: ["$pets.name", 1] }
      }
    }
  ])
  ```

A.  
```js
db.your_collection_name.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      person_name: "$name",
      person_age: "$age",
      first_pet_name: { $first: "$pets.name" },
      second_pet_name: { $last: "$pets.name" }
    }
  }
])
```

B. 
```js
db.your_collection_name.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      person_name: "$name",
      person_age: "$age",
      first_pet_name: "$pets.name[0]",
      second_pet_name: "$pets.name[1]"
    }
  }
])
```

C. 
```js
db.your_collection_name.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      person_name: "$name",
      person_age: "$age",
      first_pet_name: { $arrayElemAt: ["$pets.name", 0] },
      second_pet_name: { $arrayElemAt: ["$pets.name", 1] }
    }
  }
])
```

D.
```js
db.your_collection_name.aggregate([
  {
    $arrayElemAt: ["$name", 0]
  }
])
```

Answer: C

D. Missing $project stage:
In this variation, the $project stage is missing, which is necessary to specify the fields to be retrieved. Instead, only the $arrayElemAt operator is used, which would result in an error.

B. Incorrect use of $arrayElemAt:
In this variation, the $arrayElemAt operator is not used correctly. Instead, the array indexing is directly applied to the field path, which is invalid syntax in MongoDB aggregation.

A. Using $first and $last instead of $arrayElemAt:
In this variation, the $first and $last operators are used instead of $arrayElemAt to retrieve the "name" property of the first and last pet from the "pets" array, respectively. However, this would not provide the correct result as it would return the entire array instead of the individual elements at specific indices.
