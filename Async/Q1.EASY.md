Which of the following options is false for the following code.

```js
const myFirstPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Success!"); // Yay! Everything went well!
  }, 250);
});

myFirstPromise.then((successMessage) => {
  console.log(`Yay! ${successMessage}`);
});
```


A. The given code creates a Promise that resolves with the string "Success!" after a 250 millisecond delay. It then logs "Yay! Success!" to the console using a .then() callback function when the Promise is *fulfilled*.  
B. The given code creates a Promise that resolves with the string "Success!" after a 250 millisecond delay. It then logs "Yay! Success!" to the console using a .then() callback function when the Promise is *resolved*.  
C. The given code creates a Promise that resolves with the string "Success!" after a 250 millisecond delay. It then logs "Yay! Success!" to the console using a .then() callback function when the Promise is *rejected*.  
D. The following code has the same output as the given code.
```js
const myFirstPromise = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Success!"); // Yay! Everything went well!
    }, 250);
  });
};

(async () => {
    const successMessage = await myFirstPromise();
    console.log(`Yay! ${successMessage}`);
})();

```
