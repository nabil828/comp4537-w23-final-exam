What does the following query output?
```js
 await City.aggregate([
    { $group: { _id: '$province', avgArea: { $avg: '$area' }, totalPopulation: { $sum: '$population' } } }, // Group by province and calculate avg area and total population
    { $sort: { _id: 1 } }, // Sort by province name in ascending order
    { $project: { _id: 0, province: '$_id', avgArea: 1, totalPopulation: 1 } } // Project to include province, avg area, and total population fields
  ]);
