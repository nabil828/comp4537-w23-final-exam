Using the MongoDB find method, retrieve all the weather data documents from the "weather" collection where the temperature is greater than or equal to 20째C and the conditions include "sunny".

```json
[
  {
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "United States",
    "temperature": 22.5,
    "humidity": 60,
    "precipitation": 0.1,
    "windSpeed": 8,
    "conditions": ["sunny", "partly cloudy"],
    "updatedDate": "2023-04-06T10:30:00Z"
  },
  {
    "city": "London",
    "country": "United Kingdom",
    "temperature": 12.9,
    "humidity": 75,
    "precipitation": 0.3,
    "windSpeed": 12,
    "conditions": ["rainy", "windy"],
    "updatedDate": "2023-04-06T09:45:00Z"
  },
  {
    "city": "Sydney",
    "country": "Australia",
    "temperature": 26.7,
    "humidity": 50,
    "precipitation": 0,
    "windSpeed": 5,
    "conditions": ["sunny"],
    "updatedDate": "2023-04-06T08:15:00Z"
  }
]

```


A. 
```js
db.weather.find({ temperature: { $gte: 20 }, conditions: "sunny" })
```

B. 
```js
db.weather.find({ temperature: { $gte: 20 }, conditions: { $in: "sunny" } })
```

C. 
```js
db.weather.find({ temperature: { $gt: 20 }, conditions: "sunny" })
```

D.  
```js
db.weather.find({ temperature: { $gte: 20, $lt: 25 }, conditions: "sunny" })
```


Answer: B

Explanation: Option B is the correct answer as it correctly uses the $gte operator to filter documents with temperature greater than or equal to 20째C, and the $in operator to filter documents where the "conditions" field contains "sunny". Option A is incorrect as it only matches documents with "sunny" as the only condition, but not documents with multiple conditions. Option C is incorrect as it uses $gt instead of $gte, which would exclude documents with temperature equal to 20째C. Option D is incorrect as it uses both $gte and $lt operators, which would not correctly capture all documents with temperature greater than or equal to 20째C.
