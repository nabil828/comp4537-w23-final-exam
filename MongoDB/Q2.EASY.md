Using the MongoDB find, retrieve only the "city" and "temperature" fields for all the weather data documents from the "weather" collection where the "conditions" field is "rainy".
```json
[
  {
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "United States",
    "temperature": 22.5,
    "humidity": 60,
    "precipitation": 0.1,
    "windSpeed": 8,
    "conditions": ["sunny", "partly cloudy"],
    "updatedDate": "2023-04-06T10:30:00Z"
  },
  {
    "city": "London",
    "country": "United Kingdom",
    "temperature": 12.9,
    "humidity": 75,
    "precipitation": 0.3,
    "windSpeed": 12,
    "conditions": ["rainy", "windy"],
    "updatedDate": "2023-04-06T09:45:00Z"
  },
  {
    "city": "Sydney",
    "country": "Australia",
    "temperature": 26.7,
    "humidity": 50,
    "precipitation": 0,
    "windSpeed": 5,
    "conditions": ["sunny"],
    "updatedDate": "2023-04-06T08:15:00Z"
  }
]

```

A. 
```js
db.weather.find({ conditions: "rainy" }, { city: 1, temperature: 1 })
```

B.
```js
db.weather.find({ conditions: "rainy" }, { _id: 0, city: 1, temperature: 1 })
```

C.
```js
db.weather.find({ conditions: "rainy" }, { _id: 0, city: 0, temperature: 1 })
```

D.
```js
db.weather.find({ conditions: "rainy" }, { city: 0, temperature: 1 })
```

Answer: B

Explanation: Option B is the correct answer as it uses the projection to explicitly specify which fields to include (1) or exclude (0) from the result. It includes "date" and "temperature" fields while excluding the "_id" field. Option A is incorrect as it includes the "_id" field by default, which is not specified in the projection. Option C is incorrect as it excludes both "date" and "_id" fields from the result, which is not what the question asked for. Option D is incorrect as it only excludes the "date" field, but does not exclude the "_id" field as required.
